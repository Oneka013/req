# Licensing Information

At the moment, this product is licensed under the **MIT License**. 

> **Note:** This license applies **only** to the code we've written.

## Dependency Notice

There is currently one known dependency on a closed-source product that does **not** fall under the MIT License:

- **Dependency:** WebContainers  
  - **Status:** Closed source

### Future Plans

We are currently exploring the following options:
1. Replacing WebContainers with an open-source alternative.
2. If no suitable alternative is found, we may develop our own implementation. This would be maintained in a separate repository with its own independent release schedule.

## Recommendations

Until this dependency issue is resolved:
- It is **not recommended** to use this implementation in proprietary software due to potential downstream licensing conflicts.

## Updates

We will modify this file with new information regarding:
- Changes to the status of WebContainers or any closed-source dependencies.
- Any newly identified closed-source dependencies.

Stay tuned for more information as the situation evolves.
